    <h2>Introvert much? You've probably:</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>pretended to be sick so you don't have to go to that meeting</li>
    	<img src="images/heavy.png">
    	<br>
    	<li>stared at your ringing phone numerous times and wondered why people can't just text you instead (have you never heard of WhatsApp, man?)</li>
    	
    	<br>
        <li>stayed up all night to finish that book or get to level 200 on that game, because why not?</li>
        <br>
        <li>had to buy something online so you don't have to go to the store and face people</li>
        <br>
        <li>wondered how people make all these cool irl friends (seriously though, how do y'all do that?)</li>
        <br>
        <img src="images/asleep.png">

        <li>kept a really good idea to yourself in a meeting, because of all that attention, jesus.</li>
        <br>
        <li>been badgered to loosen up and have some fun (im good, bro. really.) </li>
        <br>
        <li>had trouble going to sleep because there are like 1235 open tabs in your head at 2:15 am</li>
        <br>
        <li>just wished and hoped your friend would call to cancel so you can stay home and do your thing</li>
        <br>
